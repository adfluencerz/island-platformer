## Baseline (phase 0)
`plaza-noon`, tier high, 960x600, pixel ratio 1 (SwiftShader), shadow pass included:
calls 960, triangles 832,626, programs 24, geometries 138, textures 11.
Calls drift by about ±20 between runs (the test farm changes as it is played): the README's `calls` budget is 1000.
Other shots (high): plaza-morning 1162 calls, forest-noon 726, lake-sunset 920, night-lamps 1575,
rain-noon 919, dungeon 389, split-2 2166, lobby 1106; phone (medium) 1269 calls, 831k triangles.
Low tier (`?lowgfx`, no shadow pass): about 271 calls, 785k triangles.

## Measured in phase 15
`npm run shots -- --tier T` (960x600, pixel ratio 1, SwiftShader), calls / triangles / programs, before -> after
(the grass in 24-tile patches and the ground surface and cliffs in 24-tile squares, out-of-view ones culled):
- high: plaza-noon 762 / 1.26M / 46 -> 787 / 831k / 44; phone 658 / 1.18M -> 661 / 505k; split-2 1505 / 1.37M; lobby 463 / 226k / 85.
- medium: plaza-noon 754 / 865k / 45 -> 773 / 611k / 43; phone 650 / 786k -> 659 / 373k; split-2 1458 / 1.01M.
- low: plaza-noon 330 / 644k / 31 -> 359 / 478k / 30; phone 165 / 548k -> 180 / 264k; split-2 556 / 756k.
- CPU a frame (headless Chromium, this container) of motes + rain + fireflies: 0.04 ms at 300 particles,
  0.06 ms at 600, 0.10 ms at 900 (g.step in a shower: about 0.1-0.17 ms of 0.2-0.4 ms a step): kept on the CPU.
- Dispose audit: geometries and textures steady over three lobby trips (home 420±10 with the last wild island
  kept), tier cycling (textures 23 / 22 / 9) and look changes (outline hull 420 <-> 422); programs only grow
  with three's per-material variants (shadows on/off), not per visit.

## Notes from the last phase
- Beach: `gfxShore` per ground vertex (world.js, 1 at a side facing open sea, 0 1.5 tiles in); on sand (ground.js tiles) a darker warm wet band breathing with a swash (uTime), a damp line and a foam lace at the edge; the cliff lip over the sea darkened to match.
- Shallows 4.5 tiles wide: a near-solid turquoise band (0x2fe2b6, opacity 0.9) with the sand's ripples brightening it, then a fainter patchy shelf; foam broken into drifting lace; the sea a deeper blue (0x18709c) in two scales of patches, the lighter greener.
- Shadow box depth now `40 + reach * 1.4` (76, was 100): a low sun's box no longer takes in casters 40-60 m past the view; plaza-morning 868 -> 795 calls, sunset likewise, noon unchanged.
- Programs unchanged (plaza-noon 50); concave coast corners stack two shallows strips (more turquoise there, reads as a shallower bay).
- Weakest now: phone (medium): the plaza small and flat, the grass thin and the stone a grey slab at that size; plaza-noon is the only other shot not yet polished.
